My name is Donald and I am a PHP developer. However, I have never contributed to open source projects or created some myself. I have used
open source and edited them for personal use. This is my first open source project, a social networking platform. I have created a really
good social network (still creating and never launched, yet), but recently, decided to start fresh from scratch and make it adaptable for
open source, allowing such things as plugins, components, etc.

I would greatly appreciate collaborators and guidance, especially in relation to the file structure. Another drawback I have, I generally
only write PHP PDO as that's what I know. I especially would like to find Ajax and JavaScript developers to assist in collaboration as I
lack some skills in those areas.

If you notice my files and folders going in an improper direction, please let me know. You can reach me at admin@social-collab.org. I
greatly appreciate it. Thanks.
