**Social Networking**

My name is **Donald** and I am a PHP developer. However, I have never contributed to open source projects or created some myself. I have used open source and edited them for personal use. This is my first open source project, a social networking platform. I have created a really good social network (still creating and never launched, yet), but recently, decided to start fresh from scratch and make it adaptable for open source, allowing such things as plugins, components, etc.

**UPDATE:** Since writing this, I have recently started learning how to use GitHub, thanks to [Lambda School](www.lambdaschool.com).

I would greatly appreciate collaborators and guidance, especially in relation to the file structure. Another drawback I have, I generally only write PHP PDO as that's what I know. I especially would like to find Ajax and JavaScript developers to assist in collaboration as I lack some skills in those areas.

If you notice my files and folders going in an improper direction, please let me know. You can reach me at admin@social-collab.org. I greatly appreciate it. Thanks.

## Database Login Required

This site is fully functional and dependent on the use of a database. To work on this website (and test), you'll need to setup a php environment or use a host/vps. Change the config.php file in the root to include your database credentials. **DO NOT** make these credentials public. Mask (******) them before pushing to github.

## Password Encryption

The current encryption method is `sha256()`. If you have a better method, feel free to make the changes on your own forked copy and request a merge. I believe `crypto()` with a `salt()` is a better method, consider fixing this.

## Features Already Considered

### Login / Register

* Users can register and login
* Real Name, Email, and Password are required fields
* Confirm Password will be on a second / step 2 page to help reduce spam bots from creating accounts
   * Spam bots usually generate a different password for each page request. Requiring a page 2 for confirm password may prevent some bots from registering.
* IP address will be logged for each new account registration to help identify fake and spam accounts with excessive use of the same IP address.
   * 4 new account creations per day maximum, with a total not to exceed 200 per year. Why 200 total? Public places, such as libraries may exceed this number (legitimately).
